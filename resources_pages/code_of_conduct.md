## MDS Leadership Code of Conduct

We include this code of conduct because we want to treat students respectfully. 

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as leaders of the Master of Data Science (MDS) program pledge to making studying under MDS a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to abide by UBC's [Respectful Environment Statement](http://www.hr.ubc.ca/respectful-environment/).

We expect students ("you") to do the same. For more detailed information, see UBC's [Student Code of Conduct](https://students.ubc.ca/campus-life/student-code-conduct).

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Personal Pronoun and Name Preference

If we fail to use your preferred pronoun (she/he/they/zhe/etc.) 
and/or preferred name, please inform us. 
We will happily refer to you by your prefered personal pronoun and name. 

## Our Responsibilities

We are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within online spaces and in public spaces
when we are representing MDS. Examples of
representing MDS include presence in the classroom, 
using an MDS Slack handle, MDS GitHub Enterprise
account, or any of our social media accounts.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting us. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. We are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Have Fun

You're embarking on a learning-centered adventure with MDS. You will experience
hardships to persevere and victories to savour. In order for you to grow 
intellectually, we need to push you outside of your intellectual comfort zone.
It's okay to feel frustrated. Remember that this is a natural part of your
journey. Keep this in mind and have fun!

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is modified from the Contributor Covenant [homepage](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4,
available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html.

The idea behind the "Personal Pronoun and Name Preference" and "Have Fun" sections come 
from the University of Texas at Austin's 
[sample syllabus](https://utexas.app.box.com/s/ccq9dpi1y4q9xitxz0rjinhmx1pbmuwj).
