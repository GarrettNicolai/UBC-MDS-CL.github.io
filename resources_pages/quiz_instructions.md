This page describes the procedure that students should take when writing quizzes. For policies, see the [Policies page](policies.html#quiz).

## Instructions

Upon arriving to the quiz room:

1. If the quiz is being held in lab, you must attend your designated lab section.
2. Sign the attendance sheet, that the TA or lab instructor has.

The next steps depend on whether the quiz is administered through _canvas_ or _github_.

### Canvas Quizzes

Your quiz period will consist of 32 minutes, where you will have 30 minutes to write the quiz.

At the start of the quiz period:

1. Go to <https://canvas.ubc.ca>, and log in with your CWL.
2. Navigate to the relevant quiz on the relevant course page.
3. Begin the quiz, fill out your answers, and click "submit". You will have a 30-minute countdown to complete the quiz.
4. Wait quietly until the quiz time slot finishes. The TA or lab instructor will specify when the quiz period is finished.

We recommend you start the quiz within 2 minutes of the quiz period starting, so that you have the full 30 minutes to write the quiz.

### GitHub Quizzes

Your quiz period will consist of 30 minutes, plus waiting time for the quiz to become available.

At the start of the quiz period:

1. Wait with your laptops closed or ajar, until the TA or lab instructor specifies that the quiz is available.
2. The TA or lab instructor will specify the time that the quiz will be closed (which is 30 minutes after the quiz becomes available).
3. Navigate to the quiz (you can find it in your `home` repo).
4. Clone the quiz repo. 
	- We recommend this over working on the browser, so that you can save and make commits more easily.
5. Fill out the quiz, _being sure to commit frequently_. 
	- In the past, many students had no work to show by the deadline due to `git` complications at the very end of the quiz period, because of not committing early and often.
6. `git push` your final changes before the specified closing time.
7. Wait quietly with your laptops closed or ajar, until the TA or lab instructor specifies that the quiz period is over.
	- This may be after the specified end-time, in case closing the quiz takes longer than anticipated.

## General Guidelines

1. Never write more than two brief sentences for any given question. Do so by writing about the big-picture idea, as opposed to minutiae. 

## Special Circumstances

#### I cannot submit the quiz!

Take screen shots of your completed quiz, and send them through Slack to the lab instructor of the course before the end of the quiz period.

#### I'm finished the quiz early.

Wait quietly with your laptop closed/ajar until the end of the quiz period.

#### I need to use the washroom

Just leave your laptop in the quiz room. 

## Instructions for TA's

1. Go to the classroom at least 5 mins before the quiz time.
2. Bring a blank sheet of paper with you. Pass it around a couple of minutes before the quiz starts and ask the students to write their name on it. You can hand it or take a picture and send it to us later. 
3. Try to walk around and make sure that at least one of the TAs stays at the back of the classroom.
4. Report to us if you observe any form of academic dishonesty or chatting in the classroom.
5. Ask the students to stay in the classroom for the full time even after they are done. (If students start leaving the classroom it can be distracting for other students.)
6. If you encounter issues during the quiz, inform the lab instructor through Slack.
7. If the quiz is administered through GitHub:
	- You will be notified via Slack by the lab instructor when the quiz becomes available, as well as when the quiz will be closed. When this happens, notify the students to begin, and notify students of the time the quiz will be closed.
	- You will be notified via Slack by the lab instructor when the quiz has successfully been closed. Notify the students when this happens.
	- It's a good idea to keep an eye on Slack now and then during the lab period to stay in the loop in case other sections are having issues.
