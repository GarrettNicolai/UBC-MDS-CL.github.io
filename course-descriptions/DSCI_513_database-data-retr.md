## Short Description
How to work with data stored in relational database systems or in formats utilizing markup languages. Storage structures and schemas, data relationships, and ways to query and aggregate such data.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1.  Use an Entity-Relationship Diagram and a database schema to determine the attributes, relationships, foreign keys, types of data, etc., in a given database.
2.  Write SQL statements to query and update tables in a database.
3.  Write programs containing embedded SQL statements to communicate with, and query, a database, thereby generating reports requiring more complicated logic and calculations than what is possible via stand-alone SQL.
4.  Write well-formed XML; use XQuery to query an XML repository.
