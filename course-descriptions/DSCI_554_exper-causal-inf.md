subtitle: Experimentation and Causal Inference

## Short Description
Statistical evidence from randomized experiments versus observational studies. Applications of randomization, e.g., A/B testing for website optimization.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Distinguish between experimentally-generated data and observational data, with particular reference to the strength of ensuing statistical conclusions.
2. Fit and interpret regression models for observational data, with particular reference to adjustment for potential confounding variables. 
3. Apply the principle of “block what you can, randomize what you cannot” in designing an A/B testing experiment.
4. Choose appropriately between fixed-effect and random-effect regression models.
