title: About UBC MDS

---

The UBC Master of Data Science (MDS) program is a 10-month professional master's program in Data Science. 
The [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC) is a comprehensive research-intensive university, consistently ranked among the 40 best universities in the world.  The MDS program was launched in September 2016 and is offered by a collaboration between the UBC [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) and [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/).
The program involves [24 one-month courses](/descriptions) followed by a two-month [Capstone Project](/capstone/about). MDS started at UBC's main campus in Vancouver, and has since expanded to the Okanagan campus and to a computational linguistics option of the program. At UBC, our students learn to: 

- Apply a scientific approach to marshalling and exploring data, generating and testing hypotheses, designing experiments, and testing/validating methods.
- Select an appropriate data analysis approach and apply it to a new problem area in a context-appropriate manner.
- Manipulate messy, ill-formed data to extract meaningful insights.
- Appropriately select and tailor data science methods to deal with diverse data types (numeric, categorical, text, dates, graphs, etc.) across diverse subject-area domains.
- Collaborate with and communicate results of data science experiments to diverse audiences, and recommend subsequent actions to decision-makers.
- Apply fundamental statistical thinking in the data analysis process, with reference to concepts such as overfitting, confounding, bias, variability, validity, and reliability.
- Apply fundamental programming principles in the data analysis process, with particular emphasis on modularity and reproducibility.
